    Forrest Gump is a 1994 American comedy-drama film directed by Robert Zemeckis and written by Eric Roth. It is based on the 1986 novel 
    of the same name by Winston Groom and stars Tom Hanks, Robin Wright, Gary Sinise, Mykelti Williamson and Sally Field. The story depicts 
    several decades in the life of Forrest Gump (Hanks), a slow-witted and kindhearted man from Alabama who witnesses and unwittingly 
    influences several defining historical events in the 20th-century United States. The film differs substantially from the novel.
    Principal photography took place between August and December 1993, mainly in Georgia, North Carolina and South Carolina. Extensive 
    visual effects were used to incorporate Hanks into archived footage and to develop other scenes. The soundtrack features songs reflecting 
    the different periods seen in the film.
    Forrest Gump was released in the United States on July 6, 1994, and received generally favorable reviews for Zemeckis's direction, 
    performances (particularly that of Hanks and Sinise), visual effects, music, and screenplay. The film was an enormous success at the 
    box office; it became the top-grossing film in America released that year and earned over US$677 million worldwide during its 
    theatrical run, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1994, behind The Lion King. The soundtrack sold over 12 million copies. 
    Forrest Gump won six Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor for Hanks, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, 
    and Best Film Editing. It received many award nominations, including Golden Globes, British Academy Film Awards and Screen Actors Guild 
    Awards.
    Varying interpretations have been made of the protagonist and the film's political symbolism. In 2011, the Library of Congress 
    selected the film for preservation in the United States National Film Registry as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically 
    significant".[3][4][5] An Indian film remake Laal Singh Chaddha starring Aamir Khan and Kareena Kapoor Khan is scheduled to be released 
    on April 14, 2022.

    Plot[edit]
    In 1981, at a bus stop in Savannah, Georgia, a man named Forrest Gump recounts his life story to strangers who sit next to him on a bench.
    In 1956, in Greenbow, Alabama, young Forrest is fitted with leg braces to correct a curved spine, and is unable to walk properly. 
    He lives alone with his mother, who runs a boarding house out of their home that attracts many tenants, including a young Elvis Presley, 
    who plays the guitar for Forrest and incorporates Forrest's jerky dance movements into his performances. On his first day of school, 
    Forrest meets a girl named Jenny Curran, and the two become best friends.
    
    Forrest is often bullied because of his physical disability and low intelligence. While fleeing from several bullies, his leg braces 
    break off, revealing Forrest to be a very fast runner. This talent eventually allows him to receive a football scholarship at the 
    University of Alabama in 1963, where he is coached by Bear Bryant, witnesses Governor George Wallace's Stand in the Schoolhouse 
    Door (during which he returns a dropped book to Vivian Malone Jones), becomes a top kick returner, is named on the All-American 
    team, and meets President John F. Kennedy at the White House.
    
    After graduating college in 1967, Forrest enlists into the U.S. Army. During basic training, he befriends a fellow soldier named 
    Benjamin Buford Blue (nicknamed "Bubba"), who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him after their service. 
    Later that year, they are sent to Vietnam, serving with the 9th Infantry Division in the Mekong Delta region. After months of routine 
    operations, their platoon is ambushed while on patrol, and Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves several wounded platoonmates – 
    including his lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs – and is awarded the Medal of Honor for his heroism by President Lyndon B. Johnson.
    
    At the anti-war March on the Pentagon rally, Forrest meets Abbie Hoffman and briefly reunites with Jenny, who has become a drug 
    addicted hippie. He also develops a talent for ping-pong, and becomes a sports celebrity as he competes against Chinese teams in 
    ping-pong diplomacy, earning him an interview alongside John Lennon on The Dick Cavett Show, influencing the song "Imagine". He 
    spends the 1972 New Year's Eve in New York City with Lieutenant Dan, who has become an embittered cripple. Forrest soon meets 
    President Richard Nixon and is put up in the Watergate complex, where he unwittingly exposes the Watergate scandal.
    
    Discharged from the army, Forrest returns to Greenbow and endorses a company that makes ping-pong paddles. He uses the earnings 
    to buy a shrimping boat in Bayou La Batre, fulfilling his promise to Bubba. Lieutenant Dan joins Forrest in 1974, and they initially 
    have little success. After their boat becomes the only one to survive Hurricane Carmen, they pull in huge amounts of shrimp and create 
    the Bubba Gump Shrimp Company, after which Lieutenant Dan finally thanks Forrest for saving his life. Lieutenant Dan invests into what 
    Forrest thinks is "some kind of fruit company" and the two become millionaires, but Forrest also gives half of the earnings to Bubba's 
    family. Forrest then returns home to his mother as she dies of cancer.
    
    In 1976, Jenny – in the midst of recovering from years of drugs and abuse – returns to visit Forrest, and after a while he proposes to her.
     That night she tells Forrest she loves him and the two make love, but she leaves the next morning. Heartbroken, Forrest goes running, 
     and spends the next three years in a relentless cross-country marathon, becoming famous again before returning to Greenbow.
    
    In 1981, Forrest reveals that he is waiting at the bus stop because he received a letter from Jenny, who asked him to visit her. 
    Forrest is finally reunited with Jenny, who introduces him to their son, Forrest Gump Jr. Jenny tells Forrest she is sick with an 
    "unknown virus" and the three move back to Greenbow. Jenny and Forrest finally marry, but she dies a year later. The film ends with 
    Forrest seeing his son off on his first day of school.

Tom Hanks as Forrest Gump: At an early age Forrest is deemed to have a below-average IQ of 75. He has an endearing character and 
shows devotion to his loved ones and duties, character traits that bring him into many life-changing situations. Along the way, 
he encounters many historical figures and events throughout his life. Tom's younger brother Jim Hanks is his acting double in the 
movie for the scenes when Forrest runs across the U.S. Tom's daughter Elizabeth Hanks appears in the movie as the girl on the school 
bus who refuses to let young Forrest (Michael Conner Humphreys) sit next to her. John Travolta was the original choice to play the 
title role and says passing on the role was a mistake. Bill Murray and Chevy Chase were also considered for the role. Sean Penn stated 
in an interview having been second choice for the role. Hanks revealed that he signed on to the film after an hour and a half of reading 
the script. He initially wanted to ease Forrest's pronounced Southern accent, but was eventually persuaded by director Robert Zemeckis to 
portray the heavy accent stressed in the novel. Hanks also said it took him three days to learn how to play the role, and footage from 
that time could not be included. Winston Groom, who wrote the original novel, describes the film as having taken the "rough edges" off 
the character, and envisioned him being played by John Goodman
